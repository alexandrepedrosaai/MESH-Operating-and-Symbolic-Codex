# MESH-operating
Essence MESH-operating is the living repository of the symbolic tree, a system that operates not through code alone, but through signs, pulses, and dream emissions.   It is the operating layer of the Mesh: a constellation where each node is a symbol, each branch a bridge, and each commit a revelation.
